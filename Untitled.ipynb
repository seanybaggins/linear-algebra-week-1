    "# Linear Algebra Week 1 testing changes\n",
    "My brother and I have decided to teach ourselves linear algebra. We plan on accomplishing this by meeting twice a week. Our first meeting is to discuss the problems that we will be tackeling throughout the week, The second is to disucss our solutions to problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first week, we agreed to work on the following from the *linear algebra step by step* textbook.\n",

    "Exercises 1.1 Problems 1a-m\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercises 1.2 Problems 2a-b, 3a-b\n",
    "\n",
    "These problems largely look like the following\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    2x - y - 4z = 0 \\\\\n",
    "    3x + 5y + 2z = 5 \\\\\n",
    "    4x - 3y + 6z = -16 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea was to convert the system of equations into an augmented matrix and use elementary row opeartions a.k.a Gaus-Jordan elimination with backwards substitution in order to solve the system of equations. The first few steps looks as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, representing the systems of equations as a augmented matrix\n",

    "\n",
    "It was at this exact moment that I started to grit my teath. To solve the following system of equations using elementary row operations meant I had to do a lot of arithmatic using fractions. I started wondering, why is it important that I am able to do this? To prove I can do fractions? I don't think so.\n",
    "\n",
    "I came to the following conclusion. That a system of linear equations can be solved using the guass-jordan elemination technique. I am a fair believer that if you didn't do it, you don't truely understand it. So, I am in this posision where I think I understand the over arching concept but am to lazy to do the math by hand. What do I do? Program the computer to do it for me :). This way I will be certain I understand the concept without doing the pain staking arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, lets begin and see if we can't make an algorithm to convert matracies into reduced row echlon form. Lets start by representing our matrix as a numpy ndarray."
